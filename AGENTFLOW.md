# AgentFlow

Ordered loop for work larger than a quick fix. The `agentflow` skill owns every
step and loads only the reference for the current mode. This file sequences the
modes and names artifact paths.

```text
Research → Grill → Plan → Stage → Review → Commit
                          ↑                     │
                          └──── Next stage ─────┘
```

Skip Research when the area is already clear. Use Plan only when sequencing,
scope tracking, or handoff needs a durable artifact. Obvious work that fits one
or two compact stages skips Plan, even when it crosses backend and frontend;
keep the confirmed reading in chat and offer implementation. Run Handoff only
when unfinished work moves to a fresh context. Run Document when the work
should become a project page.

## 1. Research (optional)

Explore the area before proposing the change. Run `agentflow research` when
findings must survive this chat. The investigation runs in a subagent.

**Done when:** the agent can name what it will change, or the step was skipped
because that is already known.

Artifacts: `.agentflow/<feature>/research/`.

## 2. Grill

Run `agentflow grill`. Settle assumptions, scope, and how the result will be
checked.

**Done when:** the user confirmed the settled list and no open decision can
change how the work will be done.

## 3. Plan (larger work)

Run `agentflow plan` when the confirmed work needs durable coordination across
several stages, non-obvious dependencies, or a likely context handoff. Compact,
obvious work continues at step 4 without a plan file.

**Done when:** `.agentflow/<feature>/plan.md` exists with the settled list and
ordered unchecked stages, or the plan was skipped because the confirmed scope
is compact and clear in the conversation.

## 4. Implement one stage

Implement only the first stage whose Complete box is unchecked. Nested tasks
are progress inside that stage. Without a plan, use the confirmed reading and
keep the current stage reviewable. Load project craft skills named in
`AGENTS.md`. Run `agentflow tdd` for test-first work.

**Done when:** the stage meets its verify checks, its Complete box is checked
(if a plan exists), and later stages match what remains.

## 5. Review

Run `agentflow review` on the completed stage. The review runs in a subagent
with what changed and why. It fixes defects and performs behavior-preserving
refactors across the affected stage, including multi-file changes. Anything
left unfixed needs a product decision, contract change, unrelated subsystem, or
cannot be verified safely.

**Done when:** avoidable production structure is gone, defects are fixed, and
every unfixed problem is in front of the user with how to fix it.

## 6. Commit

Commit with the project's normal workflow, then return to step 4 for the next
unchecked stage.

**Done when:** the stage is committed (or staged per project rules) and the next
stage is identified or the confirmed scope is complete.

## 7. Handoff (fresh context)

Run `agentflow handoff` before moving unfinished work to another chat. Attach
the plan when present and the handoff there, then resume at step 4.

**Done when:** `.agentflow/<feature>/handoff.md` exists, or the current chat
continues without a context move.

## 8. Archive / document (optional)

Run `agentflow document` when research, a plan, or a shipped change should
become a project page. It updates the existing domain page when one exists.
Otherwise it writes into the human docs tree, or
`.agentflow/docs/<domain>/`, then removes the packaged
`.agentflow/<slug>/` working files.

**Done when:** the domain page is current, or the step was skipped.
